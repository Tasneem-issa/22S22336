The "Business Communication Software" project aims to develop a comprehensive and efficient communication platform for businesses, facilitating interaction between teams and individuals. One of the key features that can be added to this system is Real-Time Chat.

The concept is to enable employees or teams to communicate directly and efficiently through instant messaging, which accelerates decision-making processes and boosts productivity. The core feature is that messages are sent and received in real-time using technologies like WebSockets, ensuring that messages appear instantly on all connected devices.

Key Functions of the Real-Time Chat Feature:
Send and Receive Messages in Real-Time: When a user sends a message, it is immediately sent to all members of the team or group chat.
Private and Group Messaging: Users can communicate either individually or within designated team groups.
User-Friendly Interface: The chat interface includes a message window where messages are displayed clearly, making it easy to read. Additionally, users can send new messages through a simple text input interface.
Instant Notifications: Users receive real-time notifications when they receive new messages, ensuring quick responses.
Message History and Reliability: Messages are stored and available for easy retrieval, ensuring continuity in conversations.
